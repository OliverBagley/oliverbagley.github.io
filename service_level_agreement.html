            graphic creation needs. For website development projects, the lead
            time extends to a minimum of 2 months, preferably 3-4 months, prior
            to the intended delivery date. We maintain our primary communication
            through email and shared documents on Google Drive, avoiding
            informal channels like Facebook and texting.
