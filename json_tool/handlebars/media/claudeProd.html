              Weighing only 6.06kg, the Frog 38 is an incredibly lightweight kids' bike that's easy to handle and manoeuvre. Young riders will feel confident as they navigate their first rides, while parents will love the bike's
              portability, whether carrying it to the park or lifting it into the car. The thin-profile aluminium frame provides a sleek, streamlined look without sacrificing durability or strength.

              Safety comes first with the Frog 38. Small, easy-to-reach brake levers are designed specifically for young hands, helping children learn to stop with greater control. The responsive braking system, combined with a
              low centre of gravity and stable frame, helps little riders stay balanced and in control, while enlarged handlebar grips offer extra protection during tumbles or sharp turns.

              their own pace, making it an ideal choice for those transitioning from balance bikes to their first pedal bike. It's a seamless way to build confidence and ease into pedalling.
